The lyrics contained in these files were not written by me, but by Faded Paper Figures (FPF), an awesome band whom you can find at http://www.fadedpaperfigures.com.

What I've done is to format the lyrics of their first 3 albums as HTML5 fragments, with hyperlinks explaining some of the key words. I extracted the lyrics and hyperlinks from an archived version of their website from August 2013, split them up, and have formatted them to be exactly like their current website, so they should be directly copyable into the code of their new website. As the fragments are not intended to make up a full page, they therefore lack the usual HTML tags, styling and documentation. However, they’ll still load in Google Chrome, so if you’re a fan that wants to read the meanings behind FPF lyrics, this will certainly do the job!

I also went through all the links, and marked any damaged/unusable ones with the comment <!--Damaged-->. The vast majority of these were removed or copyrighted YouTube videos. It would make sense to find and replace these links if this code is actually being used.

Once edits to links are made, and the fragments are copied into the HTML of the current website, the only change that may be required is some slight styling of the hyperlinks, and the page should be good to go. :)
